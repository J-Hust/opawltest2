Manoa Hui serves as Chair of Communications and Membership for OPAWL. She is excited to help expand OPAWL’s reach and visibility and especially looks forward to helping grow OPAWL’s Cleveland chapter.

Manoa is a program manager in healthcare IT strategic communications. Prior to her communications role, Manoa spent over ten years in biomedical research and regulatory compliance administration.  A longtime AAPI and social justice advocacy wonk with experience writing and copyediting for historic special interest news magazines key to the founding of AAPI, Chicana/o, feminist, queer, and Black civil rights protest movements, Manoa has always been in awe of the power of language and storytelling. As a writer and communications strategist, she seeks to leverage that power to foster empathy, self-empowerment, and recognition of marginalized people.

A Southern California native and child of immigrants, Manoa received her B.A. in English from UCLA, with an emphasis in Asian American literature. She wrote her senior honors thesis on the subversive interplay between Chinese mythology and Chinese American history in the works of Lawrence Yep. With nine winters under her belt, she thinks she’s earned a promotion from Cleveland transplant to true Clevelander. Manoa lives in the vibrant neighborhood of Old Brooklyn with her fiancé and three cats.
